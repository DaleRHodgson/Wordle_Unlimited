Play wordle as many times a day as you want!

Running wordle.py opens the console and begins playing.
Make sure that five_letter_words.txt, wordle_solutions.txt, and wordle_acceptable.txt are in the same folder as wordle.py.

Play word-guessing game Wordle in the console, without the limitation of one game per-day.
Enter 'original' when the program starts to play with the original wordle's word-list
(as of 12/01/2022), or enter 'dale' to play with a larger selection of less-curated words.


# GAMEPLAY:

Every round a secret random five-letter word is selected, and you have six attempts to
identify it. Type in any valid five-letter word and hit Return to enter your guess.
If any letters in your guess are in the secret word, they will be highlighted YELLOW,
if any letters in your guess are in the secret word and in the position you entered,
they will be highlighted GREEN. Letters which do not appear in the solution remani WHITE.

After six incorrect guesses, or correctly finding the solution you will asked if you
want to play again. Enter 'Y' to play another round, or 'N' to close the program.
